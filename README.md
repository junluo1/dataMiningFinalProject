For the project, we used the Wazobia Students Score Prediction data set from kaggle.<br><br>

This data captures performance of randomly selected students. The data has 23 attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features. The student performance data has been split into two groups, a 'training set' titled train.csv and a 'test set' titled as test.csv. We are going to perform the following steps:<br><br>

1. data preprocessing and general description
2. data visualization
3. PCA analysis
4. linear regression
5. decision tree
6. model evaluation
